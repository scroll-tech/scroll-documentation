This is the open source project for the Scroll documentation.

## Developing

```
npm install && npm run dev
```

## Docs architecture

- All articles are markdown and stored in `/src/content/docs/`.
- Navigation is JSON in `/src/config/sidebar.ts`

## Credits

- Special thanks to the Chainlink team whose documentation we forked. Their repo is available [here](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/documentation) and viewable at [https://docs.chain.link/](https://docs.chain.link/).
