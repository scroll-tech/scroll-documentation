Zero-knowledge, or ZK, is a way of proving something is accurate without revealing any information beyond the fact that it is true. This is accomplished by using mathematics to verify the validity of a statement or claim without actually revealing any of the underlying data. ZK has two valuable properties for blockchains: succinctness (can prove that a large amount of data was correctly executed using a much smaller piece of data) and privacy (through recursive ZK proofs). Scroll uses the succinctness property to store data on Ethereum Layer 1 efficiently.

ZK is becoming increasingly popular in the blockchain space as a way to improve scalability and privacy. By using ZK proofs, blockchains can verify the accuracy of complex computations and transactions without actually revealing any of the underlying data. This allows for increased privacy and security, while also reducing the amount of data that needs to be stored on the blockchain.
