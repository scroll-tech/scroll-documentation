Click the `Bridge`` button in the navigation bar to open [the Bridge app](https://scroll.io/alpha/bridge), which is based on [Hop Exchange]('https://hop.exchange/') UI. The Bridge supports **Deposit** and **Withdraw** operations.

## Deposit from Goerli to Scroll

#### Instructions

1. First, switch to the **Goerli** network in your wallet.&#x20;
2. In the bridge app, ensure that **Goerli** is on top and **Scroll Alpha** is on the bottom. You can click the "**↓**" button to switch the positions.
3. Select the token that you want to transfer from Goerli to Scroll Alpha.&#x20;
4. If this is your first time transferring an ERC20 token, you need to **Approve** the Goerli Bridge contract to access your ERC20 token.
5. Next, click the **Send** button to make the deposit. Your wallet will pop up a window asking for confirmation of the transfer transaction.
6. Once the transfer transaction is sent and confirmed, the token will be deducted from your Goerli wallet.

#### When will the token arrive in your Scroll Alpha wallet?

It could take between **8 to 14 minutes** (awaiting block to become [_Safe_](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/ethereum-commitment-levels#what-are-ethereum-commitment-levels) on Goerli) before the token shows up in your Scroll Alpha wallet. You can check the progress of deposit transactions as follows:

1. Click your wallet address at the top-right corner of the Bridge web app.&#x20;

<ClickToZoom src={bridge1} />

The pop-up panel lists the most recent transactions that you made in the Bridge app (see the image below). There are two statuses: L1 status and L2 status. For deposit transactions (L1 -> L2), once your transaction becomes _Safe_ on Goerli (**8 to 14 minutes**), you will see the **`success` ** status shown. Your funds will be relayed to L2 after this.

2. Click on the most recent transaction’s Goerli transaction hash:

<ClickToZoom src={bridge2} />

It will open the Transaction Details page in a new tab. You can see this transaction is confirmed on Goerli.

<ClickToZoom src={bridge3} />

3. Go back to the [Bridge](https://scroll.io/alpha/bridge) app. Once your transaction status shows **`success`** on L2, you should see the funds in your Scroll L2 wallet and a transaction hash:&#x20;

## Withdraw from Scroll to Goerli

#### Instructions

1. First, switch to the **Scroll L2** network in your wallet.&#x20;
2. In the bridge app, make sure that **Scroll L2** is on top, and **Goerli** is on the bottom. You can click the "**↓**" button to switch the positions.
3. Select the token (`ETH`) that you want to transfer from Scroll L2 to **Goerli**.&#x20;
4. If this is your first time transferring an ERC20 token, you need to **Approve** the L2 Bridge contract to access your ERC20 token.
5. Next, click the **Send** button to make the withdrawal. Your wallet will pop up a window asking for confirmation of the transfer transaction.
6. Once the transfer transaction is sent and confirmed, the token will be deducted from your Scroll L2 wallet.

#### When will the token arrive in your Goerli wallet?

The transferred token will arrive in your Goerli wallet after the Scroll L2 block containing this withdrawal transaction is **`Finalized`**. On the Alpha Testnet, it will take tens of minutes to a few hours for a Scroll L2 block to be finalized, but we expect this time to be significantly lower on Mainnet.

> ℹ️ Info
>
> The rollup status `Finalized` indicates that the correct execution of transactions in this block has been proven by verifying a validity proof on-chain on Goerli. For more information about rollup status, see [Scroll's Architecture Overview](https://scroll.mirror.xyz/nDAbJbSIJdQIWqp9kn8J0MVS4s6pYBwHmK7keidQs-k).

You can check the progress of withdrawal transactions as follows:

1\. Click your wallet address at the top-right corner of the Bridge web app.&#x20;

<ClickToZoom src={bridge5} />

The pop-up panel lists the most recent transactions you made in the Bridge app (see the image below). There are two statuses: L1 status and L2 status. In this case, because we are bridging from L2 -> L1, we will quickly get a **`success` ** status after submitting the transaction to the L2 Bridge. L1, on the other hand, takes **10 minutes to a few hours** to reach **`success`**.

2\. Click on the most recent transaction’s L2 transaction hash:

<ClickToZoom src={bridge6} />

It will open the _Transaction Details_ page in a new tab. You can see this transaction is confirmed on L2.

<ClickToZoom src={bridge7} />

The transaction is confirmed on L2, but still needs to be finalized on Goerli.

3\. Go back to the [Bridge](https://scroll.io/alpha/bridge) app. It takes about 10 minutes before the token shows up in your Goerli wallet. Once your transaction status shows success on L2, you should see the funds in your Goerli wallet and a transaction hash:
