To interact with our testnet, you first need to receive testnet ETH on _Goerli._ Then you may bridge from **Goerli Testnet** to **Scroll Alpha Testnet.** Here are a few Goerli faucet apps:

- [https://goerlifaucet.com](https://goerlifaucet.com/)
- [https://goerli-faucet.pk910.de](https://goerli-faucet.pk910.de/)
- [https://faucet.paradigm.xyz](https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/)

Once you receive ETH on Goerli, you should see it in your wallet on the **Goerli Network**. It may take a few seconds for them to appear, but you can check the status by looking for a transaction to your address on any [Goerli Block Explorer](https://goerli.etherscan.io/).

> ℹ️ **Note**
>
> You can only request test tokens once every 24 hours.
