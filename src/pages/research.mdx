We define the Square-Fibonacci sequence[^1], a variation of the Fibonacci sequence:

### Math

- Let $f_0 = 1, f_1 = 1$
- For $$i \geq 2$$, define $f_{i} := (f_{i-2})^2 + (f_{i-1})^2 \mod q$
  - Where $q$ is a large prime integer. We use this modulus to bound the size of each element, so that it can be represented by some predetermined number of bits.
