## Opcodes

| Opcode                      | Scroll Behavior                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `BLOCKHASH`                 | Returns `keccak(chain_id \|\| block_number)` for the last 256 blocks.                                            |
| `COINBASE`                  | Returns the fee vault address (predeployed contract `0x5300000000000000000000000000000000000005`).               |
| `DIFFICULTY` / `PREVRANDAO` | Always return 0.                                                                                                 |
| `BASEFEE`                   | Disabled because currently we disabled EIP-1559. If the opcode is encountered, the transaction will be reverted. |
| `SELFDESTRUCT`              | Disabled. If the opcode is encountered, the transaction will be reverted.                                        |

## Precompiled Contracts

| Address | Name         | Scroll behavior                                                                                 |
| ------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `0x02`  | `SHA2-256`   | Currently not supported.                                                                        |
| `0x03`  | `RIPEMD-160` | Currently not supported.                                                                        |
| `0x05`  | `modexp`     | Restrict the input values `B, E, M` to unsigned integers less than $2^{256}$.                   |
| `0x08`  | `ecPairing`  | The inputs are still multiple of 6 32-byte values, but limit the number of tuples to at most 4. |
| `0x09`  | `blake2f`    | Currently not supported.                                                                        |

The remaining precompiled contracts have the same behavior as Ethereum. However, their maximum usage within a block is constrained by a limit tied to the zkEVM circuit capacity.

## EIPs

Our sequencer was developed based on the London fork initially. We disabled some EIPs in the London fork and introduced a few EIPs from the Shanghai fork to improve the compatibility.

Disabled EIPs until the London fork:

- [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559): Fee market change and EIP-1559 transaction type
- [EIP-2930](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2930): Optional access lists
- [EIP-3198](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3198): `BASEFEE` opcode

EIPs imported from the Shanghai fork:

- [EIP-3651](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3651): Warm `COINBASE`
- [EIP-3855](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3855): `PUSH0` instruction
- [EIP-3860](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3860): Limit and meter initcode
