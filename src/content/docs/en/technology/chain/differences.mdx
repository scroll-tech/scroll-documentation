## Opcodes

| Opcode                      | Scroll Behavior                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `BLOCKHASH`                 | Returns `keccak(chain_id \|\| block_number)` for the last 256 blocks.                                            |
| `COINBASE`                  | Returns the fee vault address (predeployed contract `0x5300000000000000000000000000000000000005`).               |
| `DIFFICULTY` / `PREVRANDAO` | Always return 0.                                                                                                 |
| `SELFDESTRUCT`              | Disabled. If the opcode is encountered, the transaction will be reverted.                                        |

## Precompiled Contracts

| Address | Name         | Scroll behavior                                                                                 |
| ------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `0x03`  | `RIPEMD-160` | Currently not supported.                                                                        |
| `0x05`  | `modexp`     | Restrict the input values `B, E, M` to unsigned integers less than $2^{256}$.                   |
| `0x08`  | `ecPairing`  | The inputs are still multiple of 6 32-byte values, but limit the number of tuples to at most 4. |
| `0x09`  | `blake2f`    | Currently not supported.                                                                        |
| `0x0a`  | `point evaluation`    | Currently not supported.                                                                        |

The remaining precompiled contracts have the same behavior as Ethereum. However, their maximum usage within a block is constrained by a limit tied to the zkEVM circuit capacity.

## EIPs

Our sequencer was developed based on the London fork initially. Since then we have adopted most features from London, Shanghai, and Cancun.

Our EIP-1559 fee market behaves differently: the sequencer sets the L2 base fee (based on the L1 base fee), and we don't burn ETH.

<Aside type="caution" title="">
Opcodes related to EIP-4844, like `BLOBHASH` and `BLOBBASEFEE`, are not yet available on Scroll. Additionally, [EIP-4788](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4788) for accessing the Beacon Chain block root is not supported.
