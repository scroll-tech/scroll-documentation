A block is a collection of transactions and links to the previous block it extends.

## Block Header

The block header in Scroll mirrors the structure of Ethereum's. However, certain fields in the block header have been modified to accommodate the Layer 2 context, as detailed in the following table:

| Field               | Description                                                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `parentHash`        | The hash of the parent block.                                      |
| `uncleHash`         | Always 0.                                                          |
| `coinbase`          | Pre-deployed fee vault contract address `0x5300000000000000000000000000000000000005`.             |
| `stateRoot`         | The root hash of the state trie. It is the Poseidon                |
| `transactionsRoot ` | The hash of the transaction trie.                                  |
| `receiptsRoot `     | The hash of the transaction receipts trie.                         |
| `logsBloom`         | The data structure containing event logs                           |
| `difficulty`        | Always 0.                                                          |
| `number`            | The block number.                                                  |
| `gasLimit`          | The maximum gas allowed in the block.                              |
| `gasUsed`           | The gas used in the block.                                         |
| `timestamp`         | The block time.                                                    |
| `extraData`         | Arbitrary additional data.                                         |
| `mixHash`           | Always 0.                                                          |
| `nonce`             | Always 0.                                                          |
| `baseFee`           | Currently empty in Scroll because we haven't enabled the EIP-1559. |

## Block Time

Block time refers to the interval between two consecutive blocks. In Scroll, the block time is set at 3s. A reduced block time elevates the user experience and augments the Scroll chain's scalability.
