This is body text right under the article title. It typically is just paragraph text that's pretty straightforward. Then there's **bold text**, and _italic text_, and **_bold-italic text_**, and `inline-code` and **`bold inline code`** and even _`italic inline code`_ and **_`bold italic inline code`_**. And of course don't forget [links](#), and [**bold links**](#), and [_italic links_](#), and [**_bold-italic links_**](#).

We define the Square-Fibonacci sequence[^1], a variation of the Fibonacci sequence:

### Math

- Let $f_0 = 1, f_1 = 1$
- For $$i \geq 2$$, define $f_{i} := (f_{i-2})^2 + (f_{i-1})^2 \mod q$
  - Where $q$ is a large prime integer. We use this modulus to bound the size of each element, so that it can be represented by some predetermined number of bits.

### Tables
