## Overview

Contracts deployed for a Scroll SDK chain include both contracts on the L1 (or basechain), and contracts deployed on the L2. Additionally, the L2 has "pre-deployed" contracts, matching those on [Scroll](/en/developers/scroll-contracts#l2-predeploys).

## Primary Contracts

Although there are many contracts deployed during a new chain deployment, the most important contracts to understand are below.

### Rollup Contract

- Deployed to L1 using a proxy and also called "Scroll Chain"
- Accepts new batches and proofs posted by the `rollup-relayer` service by calling "Commit Batch" and "Finalize Batch" methods.
- Keeps track of finalized State Roots and Withdraw Roots.
- [View on Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa13BAF47339d63B743e7Da8741db5456DAc1E556) | [View Source](https://github.com/scroll-tech/scroll-contracts/blob/main/src/L1/rollup/ScrollChain.sol)

### Scroll Message Queues

- Deployed to L1 with a proxy and pre-deployed to L2
- On L1, every depost to the bridge is added as a message to the L1 message queue.
  - Messages are read by `l2geth` instances, including the sequencer, and brought into the Scroll chain via L1Message transaction types.
- On L2, every withdrawal sent through the bridge is added as a message, and each block's resulting withdraw root is made available after finalization on the L1 Rollup Contract.
  - At any time, a user can permissionlessly generate proof to [finish relaying the message on L1](/en/developers/l1-and-l2-bridging/the-scroll-messenger#finalizing-transactions-on-l1).
- Messages are added to the queues exclusively by the Messenger contracts on [L1](https://github.com/scroll-tech/scroll-contracts/blob/main/src/L1/L1ScrollMessenger.sol) and [L2](https://github.com/scroll-tech/scroll-contracts/blob/main/src/L2/L2ScrollMessenger.sol).

### Gas Oracle Contracts

- Deployed on L1 (as part of L1 Message Queue) and pre-deployed on L2
- On L1, it tracks the gas fees on L2. This is needed since L1 transactions need to pay for their L2 gas upfront.
  - Stored `l2BaseFee` can only be updated by whitelisted addresses, _TODO: is this done by `gas-oracle` on L1 and L2?_
- On L2, the contract keeps track of the fees on L1, allowing other contracts to know how the cost required to send a transaction back to L1
  - Stored `l1BaseFee` can only be updated by whitelisted addresses, _TODO: is this done by `gas-oracle` on L1 and L2?_

## Deployment Process

All contracts are available in the [scroll-contracts repo](https://github.com/scroll-tech/scroll-contracts), and [Docker files](https://github.com/scroll-tech/scroll-contracts/tree/feat-deterministic-deployment/docker) and [Foundry scripts](https://github.com/scroll-tech/scroll-contracts/tree/feat-deterministic-deployment/scripts/deterministic) used for deployment available in the `feat-deterministic-deployment` branch.

Contracts are deployed using deterministic addresses, with a salt used to generate the address of the contract. For every new deployment, a unique salt should be configured in `config.toml`.

During deployment, a simulation is first done to determine what address a contract will deploy to. This step is done during the creation the config files for each service's chart and when the `genesis.json` file is created. Contract addresses are then used to set each service's configuration (see [`gen-configs.sh`](https://github.com/scroll-tech/scroll-contracts/blob/feat-robust-deployment/docker/scripts/gen-configs.sh)).

{/* <!-- TODO: modify URL to develop branch --> */}

Then, before the `contracts` chart is installed, you will need to fund your SDK `DEPLOYER` account to deploy all contracts on L1 and L2 using actual transactions.

The `contracts` pod will connect to the cluster's RPCs and deploy the necessary contracts. 

{/* TODO: is this still true? */}
{/* To view the complete logs from the deployment process, see the `broadcast` folder in `/charts/scroll-stack/`. */}

{/* TODO: check again once we do this. */}
<Aside type="tip">
For manually deploying contracts without the reliance on a docker container, please review [this guide](https://github.com/scroll-tech/scroll-contracts/blob/feat-deterministic-deployment/docs/manual-deployment.md).
{/* TODO: Link to develop branch once merged. */}
</Aside>

### Funding Deployment Accounts

You will need to manually fund the following wallet addresses from `config.toml`:

- `DEPLOYER_ADDR` *(only needs funded on L1)*
  {/* - Suggested funds: `(L1 basefee * VARIABLE * 10e-9) ETH` */}
- `L1_COMMIT_SENDER_ADDR`
  {/* - Suggested funds: `(L1 basefee * VARIABLE * 10e-9) ETH` */}
- `L1_FINALIZE_SENDER_ADDR`
  {/* - Suggested funds: `(L1 basefee * VARIABLE * 10e-9) ETH` */}
- `L1_GAS_ORACLE_SENDER_ADDR`
  {/* - Suggested funds: `(L1 basefee * VARIABLE * 10e-9) ETH` */}
- `L2_GAS_ORACLE_SENDER_ADDR` *(funded after L2 chain deployment)*
  {/* - Suggested funds: `(L1 basefee * VARIABLE * 10e-9) ETH` */}

{/* <!-- TODO: modify for how this works after --> */}

<Aside type="tip">

To fund an L1 addresses when using Anvil, you can run the command below, replacing the first param with the address.

```bash
curl --location 'http://l1-devnet.scrollsdk/' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
  "jsonrpc":"2.0",
  "method":"anvil_setBalance",
  "params":["0x0000000005D6C5FCB0BA99480e585D2364e98000","0x3635C9ADC5DEA00000"],
  "id":0
}'
```
</Aside>

<Aside type="tip">

To fund an L2 address directly via the L1 bridge, you can run the command below, replacing the RPC and setting a private key of an account funded on L1 and a recipient address on L2.

```bash
cast send --rpc-url https://rpc2.sepolia.org  --private-key "$PRIVATE_KEY" "$L1_GATEWAY_ROUTER_PROXY_ADDR" "depositETH(address,uint256,uint256)" "$L2_RECIPENT_ADDR" "1ether" "300000" --value "1.1ether"
```
