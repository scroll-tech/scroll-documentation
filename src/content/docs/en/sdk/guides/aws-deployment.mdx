This guide demonstrates how to deploy a Scroll SDK on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) and other managed services.

This guide is designed for chain owners and developers who may not be DevOps experts but want to understand the process of setting up a more sophisticated cloud deployment compared to a local devnet.

<Aside type="caution">
Scroll SDK is in active development, and parts of this guide may change. We aim to stabilize these processes soon.

*Guide last updated October 15, 2024, referencing example files from [this commit](https://github.com/scroll-tech/scroll-sdk/tree/2988c80996b0f6413c6c374d5e9ce8bd788d52ca).*

## Getting your machine ready

### Installing Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed on your local machine:

- AWS CLI
- eksctl
- kubectl
- helm
- docker
- node ≥ 18
- [scroll-sdk-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/scroll-sdk-cli)
- k9s (optional, but recommended for cluster management)

To install the scroll-sdk-cli, run:

```bash
npm install -g scroll-sdk-cli
```

Verify your setup by running:

```bash
scrollsdk test dependencies
```

### Configuring AWS CLI

Before we begin, you need to configure your AWS CLI with your credentials:

1. Create an IAM user in AWS with appropriate permissions (AdministratorAccess for simplicity, but you may want to restrict this in production).
2. Get the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key for this user.
3. Run the following command and enter your credentials when prompted:

```bash
aws configure
```

This will create a `~/.aws/credentials` file with your AWS credentials.

### Setting up your Owner Wallet

The chain owner has the ability to upgrade essential contracts. We recommend setting up a Safe with at least 2 independently controlled signers required for managing upgrades. You may also consider adding as signers any external party that will help you execute upgrades, as they'll be able to propose new transactions.

For this demo, we'll use a temporary development account created in MetaMask. Make sure to save the private key securely.

## Setting up your infrastructure

### Creating an EKS Cluster

Let's create our EKS cluster using `eksctl`. Run the following command:

```bash
eksctl create cluster \
    --name scroll-sdk-cluster \
    --region us-west-2 \
    --nodegroup-name standard-workers \
    --node-type t3.2xlarge \
    --nodes 3 \
    --nodes-min 1 \
    --nodes-max 4 \
    --managed
```

This will create a cluster with 3 t3.2xlarge nodes, which should be sufficient for our needs. Adjust the region and node type as needed.

### Configuring Persistent Storage

After creating your EKS cluster, you need to set up persistent storage using Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS). This involves installing the EBS CSI driver, configuring IAM permissions, and setting a default storage class.

#### Installing the EBS CSI Driver

The EBS Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver allows your Kubernetes cluster to manage the lifecycle of Amazon EBS volumes for persistent storage.

1. Navigate to the EKS console for your cluster.
2. Go to the "Add-ons" section and install the "Amazon EBS CSI Driver" add-on.

<ClickToZoom src={AWSEBSDriver} alt="EBS CSI Driver" />

#### Configuring IAM Permissions  

To allow your EKS nodes to interact with EBS volumes, attach the appropriate IAM policy:

```bash
# Create an EBS policy file named ebs-policy.json:
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:CreateVolume",
                "ec2:DeleteVolume",
                "ec2:AttachVolume",
                "ec2:DetachVolume",
                "ec2:DescribeVolumes",
                "ec2:DescribeVolumesModifications",
                "ec2:ModifyVolume"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}

# Create the IAM policy:
aws iam create-policy --policy-name EKSNodeEBSPolicy --policy-document file://ebs-policy.json

# Identify your node group's IAM role:
aws eks describe-nodegroup --cluster-name scroll-sdk-cluster --nodegroup-name standard-workers --query "nodegroup.nodeRole" --output text --region us-west-2

# Attach the policy to the node group's role:
aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name <YOUR_NODEGROUP_ROLE_NAME> --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::<YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID>:policy/EKSNodeEBSPolicy
```

#### Setting the Default Storage Class

To ensure that your Kubernetes pods can automatically provision EBS volumes:

```bash
# Verify available storage classes:
kubectl get sc

# Set the gp2 storage class as the default:
kubectl patch storageclass gp2 -p '{"metadata": {"annotations":{"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class":"true"}}}'
```

These steps will configure your EKS cluster to use EBS volumes for persistent storage, which is crucial for many components of the Scroll SDK deployment.

### Installing Kubernetes Add-Ons

We know we’ll want a Ingress Controller for handling in-bound requests, a monitoring stack and a certificate manager to support HTTPS connections.
After your cluster is created, install the following add-ons:

1. NGINX Ingress Controller
```bash
helm repo add nginx-stable https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx
helm repo update
helm install nginx-ingress nginx-stable/ingress-nginx --namespace kube-system
```

2. Prometheus Stack:
```bash
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
helm install kube-prometheus-stack prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack --namespace kube-system
```

3. Cert-Manager:
```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.16.0/cert-manager.yaml
```

### Creating a Managed Database

`scroll-sdk` uses 3 distinct databases, with 2 additional databases used for L1 and L2 Blockscout instances if needed. We'll setup a single database cluster that we'll host each database and user inside (more on the setup later).

We'll use Amazon RDS for our managed PostgreSQL database. Let's set it up using the AWS CLI:

```bash
# First, let's get the VPC ID of our EKS cluster
VPC_ID=$(aws eks describe-cluster --name scroll-sdk-cluster --region us-west-2 --query "cluster.resourcesVpcConfig.vpcId" --output text)

# Now, let's create a security group for our RDS instance
SECURITY_GROUP_ID=$(aws ec2 create-security-group --group-name scroll-sdk-db-sg --description "Security group for Scroll SDK RDS" --vpc-id $VPC_ID --output text --region us-west-2)

# Get the EKS cluster security group ID
EKS_SG_ID=$(aws ec2 describe-security-groups --filters "Name=vpc-id,Values=$VPC_ID" "Name=group-name,Values=eksctl-scroll-sdk-cluster-cluster-ControlPlaneSecurityGroup*" --query "SecurityGroups[0].GroupId" --output text --region us-west-2)

# Allow inbound traffic on port 5432 (PostgreSQL) from the EKS cluster security group
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id $SECURITY_GROUP_ID --protocol tcp --port 5432 --source-group $EKS_SG_ID --region us-west-2

# Get the public subnet IDs in the VPC
SUBNET_IDS=$(aws ec2 describe-subnets --filters "Name=vpc-id,Values=$VPC_ID" "Name=map-public-ip-on-launch,Values=true" --query "Subnets[].SubnetId" --output json --region us-west-2)

# Create a DB subnet group
aws rds create-db-subnet-group \
    --db-subnet-group-name scroll-sdk-subnet-group \
    --db-subnet-group-description "Subnet group for Scroll SDK RDS" \
    --subnet-ids $(echo $SUBNET_IDS | jq -r '.[]') \
    --region us-west-2

# Now create the RDS instance
aws rds create-db-instance \
    --db-instance-identifier scroll-sdk-db \
    --db-instance-class db.t3.2xlarge \
    --engine postgres \
    --master-username scrolladmin \
    --master-user-password <your-secure-password> \
    --allocated-storage 20 \
    --vpc-security-group-ids $SECURITY_GROUP_ID \
    --db-subnet-group-name scroll-sdk-subnet-group \
    --db-name scrolldb \
    --publicly-accessible \
    --region us-west-2

# Wait for the database to be available
aws rds wait db-instance-available --db-instance-identifier scroll-sdk-db --region us-west-2
```

This command sequence does the following:
- Gets the VPC ID of our EKS cluster
- Creates a new security group for our RDS instance in the same VPC
- Allows inbound PostgreSQL traffic from the EKS cluster's security group
- Gets the subnet IDs in the VPC
- Creates a DB subnet group using the VPC subnets
- Creates a PostgreSQL database named `scrolldb`
- Uses a `db.t3.2xlarge` instance (suitable for testing, adjust as needed)
- Sets the master username to `scrolladmin` (change this as desired)
- Allocates 20GB of storage
- Makes the database not publicly accessible for better security
- Creates the database in the `us-west-2` region (adjust as needed)

Make sure to replace `<your-secure-password>` with a strong password.

After the database is created, you can retrieve its endpoint using:

```bash
aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier scroll-sdk-db --query "DBInstances[0].Endpoint.Address" --output text --region us-west-2
```
Make note of this endpoint, as you'll need it when configuring your Scroll SDK.

### Setting up a Load Balancer

When you install the NGINX Ingress Controller, it automatically creates an AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) for you. This load balancer is used to route external traffic to your Kubernetes services.

To view the created load balancer:

1. Wait a few minutes after installing the NGINX Ingress Controller for the load balancer to be provisioned.

2. You can check the status of the load balancer creation by running:

   ```bash
   kubectl get services -n kube-system
   ```

   Look for a service named something like `nginx-ingress-ingress-nginx-controller`. The `EXTERNAL-IP` column will show the DNS name of your load balancer once it's ready.

3. You can also view the load balancer in the AWS Console:
   - Go to the EC2 dashboard
   - Click on "Load Balancers" in the left sidebar
   - You should see a new load balancer created for your NGINX Ingress Controller

Remember the DNS name of this load balancer, as you'll need to point your domain to this address when configuring DNS.

<Aside type="note">
The exact name and type of the load balancer (Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer) may vary depending on your specific NGINX Ingress Controller configuration and AWS setup.
</Aside>

We'll configure the routing rules for this load balancer when we set up our ingress resources later in this guide.

### Configuring your DNS with Cloudflare

We'll use Cloudflare for DNS management, setting up a subdomain and a wildcard record. Here's how to set it up:

1. If you haven't already, create a Cloudflare account and add your domain to Cloudflare.

2. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the DNS settings for your domain.

3. Add two new DNS records:

   a. Subdomain record:
   - Type: CNAME
   - Name: scrollsdk
   - Target: Paste the DNS name of your AWS load balancer (the EXTERNAL-IP you noted earlier)
   - Proxy status: Set to "DNS only" (grey cloud icon) to bypass Cloudflare's proxy

   b. Wildcard record:
   - Type: CNAME
   - Name: *.scrollsdk
   - Target: scrollsdk.yourdomain.com
   - Proxy status: Set to "DNS only" (grey cloud icon)

4. Save your changes.

<ClickToZoom src={AWSCloudflareDNS} alt="AWS Cloudflare DNS" />
<ClickToZoom src={AWSCloudflareDNSWildcards} alt="AWS Cloudflare DNS Wildcards" />

<Aside type="note">
We're using "DNS only" mode (grey cloud icon) for both records. This bypasses Cloudflare's proxy, which is necessary because:
1. We haven't set up SSL certificates yet.
2. Cloudflare's proxy has limited support for non-HTTP/HTTPS traffic.
3. Wildcard and nested subdomain setups require additional configuration with Cloudflare's proxy.
</Aside>


Remember to update your Scroll SDK configuration to use these new subdomains. For example, you might use:

- frontends.scrollsdk.yourdomain.com for your frontend
- l2-rpc.scrollsdk.yourdomain.com for your API

Make sure to update these in your `config.toml` file and any other relevant configuration files.

<Aside type="caution">
By bypassing Cloudflare's proxy, you won't benefit from their CDN and some security features. In a production environment, you should set up proper SSL certificates and consider enabling Cloudflare's proxy features after ensuring compatibility with your specific setup.
</Aside>

### Connecting to your Cluster

After creating the cluster, `eksctl` should have automatically updated your kubeconfig. Verify the connection by running:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

You should see your cluster nodes listed.

### Adding External Secrets Operator

Scroll SDK uses [External Secrets](https://external-secrets.io/latest/introduction/getting-started/) to manage sensitive information. Once you have `kubctl` working with your cluster, please run the following:

```bash
helm repo add external-secrets https://charts.external-secrets.io
helm repo update
helm install external-secrets external-secrets/external-secrets -n external-secrets --create-namespace
```


## Setup your local repo

Create a directory for your project and initialize a git repository:

```bash
mkdir aws-scroll-sdk && cd aws-scroll-sdk && git init
```

## Configuration

### Grabbing Files from `scroll-sdk`

We'll want two files from the `scroll-sdk` repo. You can either copy paste the contents from GitHub, or copy the files from another location you've cloned.

Here, I'll copy them from a local repo copy.

```bash
cp ../scroll-sdk/examples/config.toml.example ./config.toml
```

```bash
cp ../scroll-sdk/examples/Makefile.example ./Makefile
```

```bash
cp -r ../scroll-sdk/examples/values values
```

`Config.toml` will be used to setup our base configuration of our chain, from which each service's independent config files will be generated. `Makefile` will allow us to directly run `helm` commands in an automated way. The `values` directory contains the starter values for each service's `production.yaml` file, where we'll customize the behavior of each chart.


### Preparing our Config.toml file

Although these values can be set manually, we have a number of "setup" methods in the `scroll-sdk-cli` to help you quickly configure your stack.

### Setting Domains

We want to setup our ingress hosts and the URLs used by our frontend sites. These will often be the same, but are defined separately to allow flexibility in architecture and usage of HTTP while in development.

If you're using a public testnet like Scroll Sepolia, please have a private L1 RPC URL ready for HTTPS and WSS. Public RPC endpoints are too unreliable for supporting the SDK backend services.

First, run `scrollsdk setup domains` to begin an interactive session for setting the values.

```
Current domain configurations:
EXTERNAL_RPC_URI_L1 = "http://l1-devnet.scrollsdk"
EXTERNAL_RPC_URI_L2 = "http://l2-rpc.scrollsdk"

? Do you want all external URLs to share a URL ending? yes
? Enter the shared URL ending: scrollsdk.yourdomain
? Choose the protocol for the shared URLs: HTTPS

? Do you want to update the config.toml file with these new confi
```
<Aside type="danger">
The CLI tool is still experimental, so please remember you can manually modify any `config.toml` values at this stage.
</Aside>

### Initializing our Databases and Database Users

We need to temporarily allow public access to our RDS instance to run the initial setup. After setup, we'll revert these changes to maintain security.


1. Update the security group to allow inbound traffic from any IP:

```bash
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \
--group-id $SECURITY_GROUP_ID \
--protocol tcp \
--port 5432 \
--cidr 0.0.0.0/0 \
--region us-west-2
```

2. Get the public endpoint of your RDS instance:

```bash
aws rds describe-db-instances \
--db-instance-identifier scroll-sdk-db \
--query 'DBInstances[0].Endpoint.Address' \
--output text \
--region us-west-2
```


3. Run the database initialization:

```bash
scrollsdk setup db-init
```

Next, follow the prompts to create the new database users and passwords.

When prompted “Do you want to connect to a different database cluster for this database?”, type “no”.

Lastly, when asked “Do you want to update the config.toml file with the new DSNs?” select “yes” to update your config.

### Generate Keystore Files

Next, we need to generate new private keys for the sequencer signer and the SDK accounts used for on-chain activity. The prompt will also ask if you want to setup backup sequencers. These will be standby fullnodes ready to take over the sequencer role if needed for recovery or key rotation. This step will also allow you to setup pre-defined bootnodes.

This step will also update `L2_GETH_STATIC_PEERS` to point to all sequencer as well.

Follow the prompt by running `scrollsdk setup gen-keystore`. Use the Owner wallet address of the multi-sig generated in the first step, or for testing, allow the script to generate a wallet for you. But, be sure to save the private key, as it should not be stored in config.toml!


### Generate Configuration Files

Now, we'll do the last steps for generating each service's configuration files based on our values in `config.toml`.

Run `scrollsdk setup configs`.

You'll see a few prompts to update a few remaining values, like the L1 height at contract deployment and the "deployment salt" which should be unique per new deployment with a deployer address.

Now, we'll simulate contract deployment to get contract addresses and build the config files and secrets files for all SDK services. Secrets will be written to `./secrets` and config files to `./values`. If you want the config files written to a different directory, pass the `--configs-dir` flag.

### Pull Charts and Move Config Files

Now, we need to prepare the Helm charts. We will check access to charts, review the Makefile and check the values files for any missing values.

To do this, run `scrollsdk setup prep-charts`

<Aside type="danger">
If you haven't setup docker permissions for accessing the private repo, you can create a legacy token with access to the `scroll-sdk` repo and run this command:

`scrollsdk setup prep-charts --github-username=[username] --github-token=[token]`
</Aside>

After pulling the charts, the CLI tool will try to auto-fill each chart's `production.yaml` file.

You will be prompted with each update, and even flagged for empty values. Be sure to sanity check these values to make sure you didn't setup something incorrectly earlier. If you did, re-run any earlier steps, being sure to rerun the `setup configs` command before running `setup prep-charts` .

### Push Secrets

Lastly, we need to take the configuration values that are sensitive and publish them to wherever we're deploying "secrets."

We'll use AWS Secrets Manager to store our secrets. First, let's set up the necessary permissions and create a ServiceAccount:

1. Create an IAM policy for accessing Secrets Manager:

```bash
cat <<EOF > secretsmanager-policy.json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
                "secretsmanager:DescribeSecret",
                "secretsmanager:PutSecretValue",
                "secretsmanager:CreateSecret",
                "secretsmanager:DeleteSecret",
                "secretsmanager:TagResource"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
EOF

aws iam create-policy --policy-name ExternalSecretsPolicy --policy-document file://secretsmanager-policy.json
```

2. Associate an IAM OIDC provider with your cluster:

```bash
eksctl utils associate-iam-oidc-provider --region=us-west-2 --cluster=scroll-sdk-cluster --approve
```

3. Create a ServiceAccount and associate it with the IAM role:

```bash
eksctl create iamserviceaccount \
    --name external-secrets \
    --namespace default \
    --cluster scroll-sdk-cluster \
    --attach-policy-arn arn:aws:iam::YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID:policy/ExternalSecretsPolicy \
    --approve \
    --region us-west-2
```

Replace `YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID` with your actual AWS account ID.

4. Create a SecretStore:

```yaml
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
kind: SecretStore
metadata:
  name: aws-secretsmanager
spec:
  provider:
    aws:
      service: SecretsManager
      region: us-west-2
      auth:
        jwt:
          serviceAccountRef:
            name: external-secrets
```

Apply this configuration:

```bash
kubectl apply -f secretstore.yaml
```

Now, push your secrets:

```bash
scrollsdk setup push-secrets
```

Select "AWS" when prompted.

You'll be asked to update your `production.yaml` files, and we'll be ready to deploy!

### Enable TLS & HTTPS

Next, we'll want to enable HTTPS access. You should have already enabled Cert Manager in the previous step.

Now, save the following file as `cluster-issuer.yaml` (being sure to use your own email address) then run `kubectl apply -f cluster-issuer.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-prod
spec:
  acme:
    server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    email: replace.this@email.com
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: letsencrypt-prod
    solvers:
      - http01:
          ingress:
            class: nginx
```

Next, run `scrollsdk setup tls` and walk through the instructions to update each of your `production.yaml` files that define an external hostname.

## Deployment

### Fund the Deployer

We need to send some Anvil Devnet ETH to the Deployer — 2 ETH should do it. Run the following if you want to use your mobile wallet or have forgotten the account.

```bash
scrollsdk helper fund-accounts -i -f 2
```

`-i` is used for funding the deployer. Later we'll run this with different params to fund other SDK accounts.

Now, let's fund the other L1 accounts.

```bash
scrollsdk helper fund-accounts -f 0.2 -l 1
```

Here, we pass `-l 1` to only fund the L1 accounts. Any L2 funding will fail at this point since we haven't launched the chain yet!

### Installing the Helm Charts

Run `make install` to install (or later, to upgrade) all the SDK charts needed. It may help to run the commands one-by-one the first time, and check the deployment status. `k9s` is a useful tool for this. The sample Make file also doesn't include Blockscout, but feel free to add it as well.

### Fund L2 accounts

Let's fund our L1 Gas Oracle Sender (an account on L2 😅) with some funds.

```bash
scrollsdk helper fund-accounts -f 0.2 -l 2
```

This will fund it with 0.2 of our gas token. Select "Directly fund L2 Wallet" for now, since our Deployer starts with 1 token on L2. But now we have a working chain, so we can start bridging funds!

## Testing

`scroll-sdk-cli` has a number of tools built in for testing your new network. These commands should be run from the same directory as your `config.toml` and `config-contracts.toml` files.

### Ingress

Run `scrollsdk test ingress` to check all ingresses and that they match the expected value. If you're not using the default namespace, add `-n [namespace]`.

### Contracts

Run `scrollsdk test contracts` to check all contract deployments, initialization and owner updates.

### e2e Test

Run `scrollsdk test e2e` to try end-to-end testing. Without any flags, the test will create and fund a new wallet, but depending on Sepolia gas costs, you may need to manually fund the generated account with additional ETH. If the tests stop at any time, just run `scrollsdk test e2e -r` to resume from the saved file.

We recommend opening up another terminal and running `scrollsdk helper activity -i 1` to generate traffic and produce more blocks — otherwise, finalization will be stopped.

### Optimize EKS Node Groups for Specific Services

As you work with your network, you might want to be more selective about the node groups you provide to services.

One example is that the `l2-sequencer` may want additional CPU-resources and the `coordinator-api` has RAM requirements far greater than other services.

If you'd like to give this a try, create a new node group in your EKS cluster -- perhaps selecting instances with higher CPU and RAM.

Now, in your `values/l2-sequencer-production-0.yaml` file, add the following section:

```yaml
affinity:
  nodeAffinity:
    requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
            - key: eks.amazonaws.com/nodegroup
              operator: In
              values:
                - high-performance-nodegroup
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "450Mi"
    cpu: "80m"
  limits:
    memory: "14Gi"
    cpu: "7.5"
```

Here, we're adding asking it to only select nodes that are in the "high-performance-nodegroup" and increasing the resources of the pod to allow up to 7.5 CPU cores.

To apply this, run:

```bash
helm upgrade -i l2-sequencer-0 oci://ghcr.io/scroll-tech/scroll-sdk/helm/l2-sequencer \
  --version=0.0.11 \
  --values values/l2-sequencer-production-0.yaml
```

Replace with the version value from your Makefile. Add `-n [namespace]` if you're not using the default namespace.

### Add Redundancy with Replicas

Soon, we'll add more information about quickly adding Replicas.

For some components (like `l2-rpc` and all `-api` services), this is as easy as adding or modifying the following value in your production.yaml file:

```yaml
controller:
  replicas: 2
```

Some services do not support this without additional configurations (for example, `l2-sequencer` and `l2-bootnode`). We are working on additional info on how to properly run multiple services for loadbalancing between or for having redundant backups available.
