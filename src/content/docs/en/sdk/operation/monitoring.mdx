Scroll SDK provides a comprehensive monitoring system to ensure the health and performance of the network. This section provides an overview of the monitoring tools and best practices for using them.

## Grafana

### Service Dashboards

We've build and made available a few Grafana dashboards for Scroll SDK chains. These include views for the following services:
- bridge-history-api
- bridge-history-fetcher
- chain-monitor
- coordinator-api
- coordinator-cron
- gas-oracle
- l2geth instances (including l2-sequencer, l2-bootnode and l2-rpc)
- rollup-node

You can access these from the scroll-sdk repo [here](https://github.com/scroll-tech/scroll-sdk/tree/develop/charts/scroll-sdk/grafana/scroll-dashboards).

<Aside type="caution">
Although these are configured to work out-of-the-box with the devnet deployment, you may need to make modifications if you're using your own Prometheus or Grafana configurations.
</Aside>

<Aside type="tip">
We'll return to this section to provide more detailed overviews of how to identify some of the most useful metrics in each dashboard.
</Aside>

### Alerting

{/* TODO: Document what we have alerts setup for. */}

For a detailed guide on configuring and setting up AlertManager, you can refer to the [official documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/configuration/).

## Scroll Admin System

{/* TODO: Return with a screenshot of the admin system and a brief overview of what you can do in each area. */}

## Balance Checker

{/* TODO: Return with simple overview of balance-checker, how to set it up, and what it does. */}

## Chain Monitor

Chain Monitor can be configured to send Slack notifications if:
- deposit and withdraw messages from L1 and L2 don't match
- asset value on escrow contracts doesn't match the deposit or withdraw messages
- WithdrawRoots don't match

To set this up, set a Webhook URL in the `slack_webhook_config` section of the `chain-monitor` config.

## Prometheus Metrics

Below are tables of Prometheus metrics for each service in the Scroll SDK:
