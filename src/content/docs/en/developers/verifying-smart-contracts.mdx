After deploying your smart contracts, it's important to verify your code on [our block explorer](https://scrollscan.com/) or the [Sepolia block explorer](https://sepolia-blockscout.scroll.io).

This can be done in an automated way using your developer tooling or using Blockscout's Web UI.

<Aside type="tip" title="Blockscout vs Etherscan">
  The below instructions for verifying on our Sepolia Blockscout instance will need to be altered to work with Etherscan
  deployments. As additional services come online for mainnet, we'll update these instructions.
</Aside>

## Using Developer Tools

Most smart contract tooling has plugins for verifying your contracts easily on Etherscan. Blockscout supports Etherscan's contract verification APIs, and it's straightforward to use these tools with the Scroll Sepolia Testnet.

### Hardhat

First, modify `hardhat.config.ts` to point to Scroll's RPC and `sepolia-blockscout.scroll.io/api`. A dummy `apiKey` value is required, but anything works for its value.

```javascript
...

const config: HardhatUserConfig = {
  ...
  networks: {
    scrollSepolia: {
      url: 'https://sepolia-rpc.scroll.io' || '',
      accounts:
        process.env.PRIVATE_KEY !== undefined ? [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY] : [],
    },
  },
  etherscan: {
    apiKey: {
      scrollSepolia: 'abc',
    },
    customChains: [
      {
        network: 'scrollSepolia',
        chainId: 534351,
        urls: {
          apiURL: 'https://sepolia-blockscout.scroll.io/api',
          browserURL: 'https://sepolia-blockscout.scroll.io/',
        },
      },
    ],
  },
}

...
```

Now you can verify the smart contract by running the following command.

```solidity
npx hardhat verify --network scrollSepolia <contract address> <space separated constructor parameters>
```

For example, this is how a smart contract that receives two uint parameters in the constructor should look:

```solidity
npx hardhat verify --network scrollSepolia 0xD9880690bd717189cC3Fbe7B9020F27fae7Ac76F 123 456
```

<Aside type="danger" title="Warning">
  You may receive an error stating `etherscan.apiKey.trim is not a function` . If so, you need to update
  `@nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan` to be able to support custom chains. Try running `npm update
  @nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan`
</Aside>

### Foundry

<Aside type="danger" title="Warning">
  Our Blockscout instance currently has inconsistent behavior in verifying contracts with Foundry. We're working on a
  fix, along with other stability improvements. Don't hesitate to come ask for help [on
  Discord](https://discord.com/channels/853955156100907018/1028102371894624337) though.
</Aside>

When using Foundry, the `verify-contract` helps automate the process of verifying contracts.

```bash
forge verify-contract <Contract Address> <Space separated params> <Solidity file>:<Contract name> --chain-id 534351 --verifier-url https://sepolia-blockscout.scroll.io/api\? --verifier blockscout
```

<Aside type="danger" title="Warning">
  Notice we add `\?` at the end of the verifier URL or otherwise verification would fail. (Last tested on forge v0.2.0).
