## Deposit ERC1155 tokens from L1

ERC1155 bridging from L1 to L2 is done via the L1ERC1155Gateway. Similarly to ERC721 bridging, we don't use a router but the `depositERC1155` function on the Gateway directly.

<Aside type="tip" title="">
  **`depositERC1155`** is a payable function, and the amount of ETH sent to this function will be used to pay for L2
  fees. If the amount is not enough, the transaction will not be sent. All excess eth will be sent back to the sender.
  `0.00001 ETH` should be more than enough to process a token deposit.
</Aside>

### Creating an ERC1155 token on L2

Similar to ERC721 bridging, in order to bridge ERC1155 tokens, a contract compatible with the `IScrollERC1155` standard has to be launched and mapped on a `L1ERC1155Gateway` and `L2ERC1155Gateway` on both L1 and L2 respectively. This contract has to grant permission to the Gateway on L2 to mint when a token is deposited and burn when the token is withdrawn.

The following interface is the `IScrollERC1155` needed for deploying ERC1155 tokens compatible with the `L2ERC1155Gateway` on L2.

```solidity
interface IScrollERC1155 {
  /// @notice Return the address of Gateway the token belongs to.
  function gateway() external view returns (address);

  /// @notice Return the address of counterpart token.
  function counterpart() external view returns (address);

  /// @notice Mint some token to recipient's account.
  /// @dev Gateway Utilities, only gateway contract can call
  /// @param _to The address of recipient.
  /// @param _tokenId The token id to mint.
  /// @param _amount The amount of token to mint.
  /// @param _data The data passed to recipient
  function mint(address _to, uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _amount, bytes memory _data) external;

  /// @notice Burn some token from account.
  /// @dev Gateway Utilities, only gateway contract can call
  /// @param _from The address of account to burn token.
  /// @param _tokenId The token id to burn.
  /// @param _amount The amount of token to burn.
  function burn(address _from, uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _amount) external;

  /// @notice Batch mint some token to recipient's account.
  /// @dev Gateway Utilities, only gateway contract can call
  /// @param _to The address of recipient.
  /// @param _tokenIds The list of token ids to mint.
  /// @param _amounts The list of corresponding amount of token to mint.
  /// @param _data The data passed to recipient
  function batchMint(
    address _to,
    uint256[] calldata _tokenIds,
    uint256[] calldata _amounts,
    bytes calldata _data
  ) external;

  /// @notice Batch burn some token from account.
  /// @dev Gateway Utilities, only gateway contract can call
  /// @param _from The address of account to burn token.
  /// @param _tokenIds The list of token ids to burn.
  /// @param _amounts The list of corresponding amount of token to burn.
  function batchBurn(address _from, uint256[] calldata _tokenIds, uint256[] calldata _amounts) external;
}
```

### Adding an ERC1155 token to the Scroll Bridge

All assets can be bridged securely and permissionlessly through Gateway contracts deployed by any developer. However, Scroll also manages an ERC1155 Gateway contract where all NFTs created by the community are welcome. Being part of the Scroll-managed Gateway means you won't need to deploy the Gateway contracts, and your token will appear in the Scroll frontend. To be part of the Scroll Gateway, you must contact the Scroll team to add the token to both L1 and L2 Gateway contracts. To do so, follow the instructions on the [token lists](https://github.com/scroll-tech/token-list) repository to add your token to the Scroll official frontend.

## Withdraw ERC1155 tokens from L2

The `L2ERC1155Gateway` contract is used to send tokens from L2 to L1. Before bridging, the `L2ERC1155Gateway` contract has to be approved by the token contract. Once that is done, `withdrawERC1155` can be called to perform the asset bridge.

<Aside type="tip" title="">
  **`withdrawERC1155`** is a payable function, and the amount of ETH sent to this function will be used to pay for L1
  fees. If the amount is not enough, the transaction will not be sent. All excess ETH will be sent back to sender. Fees
  depend on L1 activity but `0.005 ETH` should be enough to process a token withdrawal.
</Aside>

<Aside type="caution" title="">
  **Make sure the transaction won't revert on L1** while sending from L2. There is no way to recover tokens bridged if
  you're transaction reverts on L1. All assets are burnt on L2 when the transaction is sent, and it's impossible to mint
  them again.
