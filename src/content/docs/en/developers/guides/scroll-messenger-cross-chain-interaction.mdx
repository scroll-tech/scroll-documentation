In this example, we will launch a dummy smart contract on either Sepolia or Scroll and interact
with it from the opposite chain. We will be using the `ScrollMessenger` that is deployed on both
Sepolia and Scroll.

## Deploying the Contracts

### Target Smart Contract

Let’s start by deploying the target smart contract. We will use the Greeter contract for this
example, but you can use any other contract. Deploy it to either Sepolia or Scroll. On Scroll, L1
and L2 use the same API, so it’s up to you.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.16;

// This Greeter contract will be interacted with through the ScrollMessenger across the bridge
contract Greeter {
  string public greeting = "Hello World!";

  // This function will be called by executeFunctionCrosschain on the Operator Smart Contract
  function setGreeting(string memory greeting_) public {
    greeting = greeting_;
  }
}
```

We will now execute `setGreeting` in a cross-chain way.

### Operator Smart Contract

Switch to the other chain and deploy the `GreeterOperator`. So, if you deployed the `Greeter` contract on L1, deploy the `GreeterOperator` on L2 or vice versa.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.16;

// The Scroll Messenger interface is the same on both L1 and L2, it allows sending cross-chain transactions
// Let's import it directly from the Scroll Contracts library
import "@scroll-tech/contracts@0.1.0/libraries/IScrollMessenger.sol";

// The GreeterOperator is capable of executing the Greeter function through the bridge
contract GreeterOperator {
  // This function will execute setGreeting on the Greeter contract
  function executeFunctionCrosschain(
    address scrollMessengerAddress,
    address targetAddress,
    uint256 value,
    string memory greeting,
    uint32 gasLimit
  ) public payable {
    IScrollMessenger scrollMessenger = IScrollMessenger(scrollMessengerAddress);
    // sendMessage is able to execute any function by encoding the abi using the encodeWithSignature function
    scrollMessenger.sendMessage{ value: msg.value }(
      targetAddress,
      value,
      abi.encodeWithSignature("setGreeting(string)", greeting),
      gasLimit,
      msg.sender
    );
  }
}
```

## Calling a Cross-chain Function

We pass the message by executing `executeFunctionCrosschain` and passing the following parameters:

- `scrollMessengerAddress`: This will depend on where you deployed the `GreeterOperator` contract.
  - If you deployed it on Sepolia use `0x50c7d3e7f7c656493D1D76aaa1a836CedfCBB16A`. If you deployed on Scroll use `0x781e90f1c8Fc4611c9b7497C3B47F99Ef6969CbC`.
- `targetAddress`: The address of the `Greeter` contract on the opposite chain.
- `value`: In this case, it is `0` because the `setGreeting`is not payable.
- `greeting`: This is the parameter that will be sent through the message. Try passing `“This message was crosschain!”`
- `gasLimit`:
  - If you are sending the message from L1 to L2, around `1000000` gas limit should be more than enough.
  - If you are sending the message from L2 to L1, pass `0`, as the transaction be completed by executing an additional transaction on L1.

### Relay the Message when sending from L2 to L1

When a transaction is passed from L2 to L1, an additional "execute withdrawal transaction" must be sent on L1. To do this, you must call `relayMessageWithProof` on the L1 Scroll Messenger
contract from an EOA wallet.

You can do this directly on [Etherscan Sepolia](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x50c7d3e7f7c656493d1d76aaa1a836cedfcbb16a#writeProxyContract#F3).
To do so, you will need to pass a Merkle inclusion proof for the bridged transaction and other parameters. You'll query these using the Scroll Bridge API.

{/* TODO: finish looking into API issues */}

We're finalizing the API specifics, but for now, fetch or curl the following endpoint:

```bash
curl "https://sepolia-api-bridge.scroll.io/api/claimable?page_size=10&page=1&address=GREETER_OPERATOR_ADDRESS_ON_L2"
```

Replace `GREETER_OPERATOR_ADDRESS_ON_L2` with your GreeterOperator contract address as launched on L2. Read more about Execute Withdraw transactions
in the [Scroll Messenger](/developers/l1-and-l2-bridging/the-scroll-messenger) article.

<Aside type="danger" title="Experimental API">
  This API was made for our Bridge UI. It is not yet finalized and may change in the future. We will update this guide
  when the API is finalized.
</Aside>

<Aside type="caution" title="Anyone can execute your L2 → L1 Message">
  `relayMessageWithProof` is fully permissionless, so anyone can call it on your behalf if they're willing to pay the L1
  gas fees. This feature allows for additional support infrastructure, including tooling to automate this process for
  applications and users.
</Aside>

After executing and confirming the transaction on both L1 and L2, the new state of `greeting` on the `Greeter` contract should be `“This message was crosschain!”`. Sending a message from one chain to the other should take around 20 minutes after the transactions are confirmed on the origin chain.

Congratulations, you now executed a transaction from one chain to the other using our native bridge!
