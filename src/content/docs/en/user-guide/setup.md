## Wallet

You need to have a wallet to interact with dApps on the Scroll Testnet. You can find some example wallets and configuration tips below.

### MetaMask

You can install MetaMask from their [official website](https://metamask.io/download/).

You need to import the Alpha Testnet configurations to your MetaMask wallet. To do this, click all **Add to wallet** buttons on the [Alpha Testnet homepage](https://scroll.io/alpha). This will import the chain ID and RPC URLs for the Scroll Alpha Testnet. The Goerli Testnet is configured on Metamask by default. To show it, click "Show/hide test networks" in the MetaMask network selection dropdown menu.

### Manual network configuration (for other wallets)

Currently, the **Add to wallet** links may not be compatible with all wallets yet. If you are having issues using them, you may need to manually add the _Goerli Testnet_ and _Scroll Alpha_ network by inserting the configuration details from the table below:

| Network Name       | Scroll Alpha Testnet                                             | Goerli Testnet                                                                                             |
