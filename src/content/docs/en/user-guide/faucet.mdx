To interact with our testnet, you first need to receive testnet ETH on _Sepolia Testnet_. Then you may bridge from _Sepolia Testnet_ to _Scroll Sepolia Testnet_.

## Sepolia Faucets

Each faucet has its own rules and requirements, so you may need to try a few before you find one that works for you.

Here are a few Sepolia faucet apps:

Once you receive ETH on Sepolia, you should see it in your wallet on the _Sepolia Network_. It may take a few seconds for them to appear, but you can check the status by looking for a transaction to your address on a [Sepolia Block Explorer](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/).

:::note[Pace Yourself!]
Most faucets only allow requests for test tokens once every 24 hours.

## Scroll Sepolia Faucets

If you don't want to interact with the bridge, some faucets directly distribute Scroll Sepolia ETH.
