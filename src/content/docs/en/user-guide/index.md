Thank you for testing the Scroll Sepolia Testnet. If you have questions or want to give feedback, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/scroll)!

The Sepolia Testnet consists of _Ethereum's Sepolia Testnet_ and the _Scroll Sepolia_ test network. Sepolia is an Ethereum test network, while Scroll Sepolia is a zero-knowledge rollup testnet deployed on top of the former. There are some pre-deployed demo applications: a [bridge](https://scroll.io/bridge) between _Sepolia_ and _Scroll Sepolia_,[^1] a [block explorer](https://sepolia-blockscout.scroll.io/) for _Scroll Sepolia_,[^2] and a [rollup explorer](https://scroll.io/rollupscan).

To view L1 transactions, check out Etherscan's [Sepolia explorer](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/).

Here is the suggested workflow to explore the Testnet:

1. Add the [Sepolia Testnet](https://scroll.io/portal) configurations to your wallet.
2. Request test tokens in the _Sepolia_ network from any Ethereum Faucet app. (see [Faucet](/user-guide/faucet) article)
3. Transfer test tokens from _Sepolia_ to _Scroll Sepolia_ through the [Bridge](https://scroll.io/bridge) app.
4. Transfer tokens to other wallets on _Scroll Sepolia_ using your wallet.
5. Explore our ecosystem, interacting with contracts like [Uniswap](http://uniswap-showcase.sepolia.scroll.xyz/).
6. Withdraw tokens from _Scroll Sepolia_ to _Sepolia_ through the [Bridge](https://scroll.io/bridge) app.

You can find the instructions for each app in the rest of this user guide.
