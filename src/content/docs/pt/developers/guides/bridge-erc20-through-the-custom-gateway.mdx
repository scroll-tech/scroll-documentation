This guide will walk through how to use Scroll's bridge for ERC20s that need custom functionality by using the Custom Gateway.

<Aside type="tip" title="Do you need custom logic?">
  Remember, for many contexts, you won't need to use the Custom Gateway to add additional features to your token or to
  its bridging logic. See the article on [ETH and ERC20 Token
  Bridge](/developers/l1-and-l2-bridging/eth-and-erc20-token-bridge#deposit-eth-and-erc20-tokens-from-l1) for more info.
</Aside>

## Step 1: Launch a token on Sepolia

First, we need a token to bridge. There is no need for a particular ERC20 implementation in order for a token to be compatible with L2. If you already have a token, feel free to skip this step. If you want to deploy a new token, use the following contract of a simple ERC20 token that mints 1 million tokens to the deployer when launched.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.16;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract L1Token is ERC20 {
  constructor() ERC20("My Token L1", "MTL1") {
    _mint(msg.sender, 1_000_000 ether);
  }
}
```

## Step 2: Launch the counterpart token on Scroll Sepolia testnet

Next, you'll launch a counterpart to this token on Scroll, which will represent the original token on Sepolia. This token can implement custom logic to match that of the L1 token or even add additional features beyond those of the L1 token.

For this to work:

- The token must implement the `IScrollStandardERC20` interface in order to be compatible with the bridge.
- The contract should provide the gateway address and the counterpart token addresses (the L1 token we just launched) under the `gateway()` and `counterpart()` functions. It should also allow the L2 gateway to call the token `mint()` and `burn()` functions, which are called when a token is deposited and withdrawn.

The following is a complete example of a token compatible with the bridge. To the constructor, you will pass the official Scroll Custom Gateway address (`0x058dec71E53079F9ED053F3a0bBca877F6f3eAcf`) and the address of the token launched on Sepolia.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.16;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
import "@scroll-tech/contracts@0.1.0/libraries/token/IScrollERC20Extension.sol";

contract L2Token is ERC20, IScrollERC20Extension {
  // We store the gateway and the L1 token address to provide the gateway() and counterpart() functions which are needed from the Scroll Standard ERC20 interface
  address _gateway;
  address _counterpart;

  // In the constructor we pass as parameter the Custom L2 Gateway and the L1 token address as parameters
  constructor(address gateway_, address counterpart_) ERC20("My Token L2", "MTL2") {
    _gateway = gateway_;
    _counterpart = counterpart_;
  }

  function gateway() public view returns (address) {
    return _gateway;
  }

  function counterpart() external view returns (address) {
    return _counterpart;
  }

  // We allow minting only to the Gateway so it can mint new tokens when bridged from L1
  function transferAndCall(address receiver, uint256 amount, bytes calldata data) external returns (bool success) {
    transfer(receiver, amount);
    data;
    return true;
  }

  // We allow minting only to the Gateway so it can mint new tokens when bridged from L1
  function mint(address _to, uint256 _amount) external onlyGateway {
    _mint(_to, _amount);
  }

  // Similarly to minting, the Gateway is able to burn tokens when bridged from L2 to L1
  function burn(address _from, uint256 _amount) external onlyGateway {
    _burn(_from, _amount);
  }

  modifier onlyGateway() {
    require(gateway() == _msgSender(), "Ownable: caller is not the gateway");
    _;
  }
}
```

## Step 3: Add the token to the Scroll Bridge

You need to contact the Scroll team to add the token to `L2CustomERC20Gateway` contract in Scroll and `L1CustomERC20Gateway` contract in L1. In addition, follow the instructions on the [token lists](https://github.com/scroll-tech/token-list) repository to add your token to the Scroll official bridge frontend.

## Step 4: Deposit tokens

Once your token has been approved by the Scroll team, you should be able to deposit tokens from L1. To do so, you must first approve the `L1CustomGateway` contract address on Sepolia (`0x31C994F2017E71b82fd4D8118F140c81215bbb37`). Then, deposit tokens by calling the `depositERC20` function from the `L1CustomGateway` contract. This can be done using [our bridge UI](https://scroll.io/bridge), [Etherscan Sepolia](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x31C994F2017E71b82fd4D8118F140c81215bbb37#writeProxyContract), or a smart contract.

## Step 5: Withdraw tokens

You will follow similar steps to send tokens back from L2 to L1. First, approve the `L2CustomGateway` address (`0x058dec71E53079F9ED053F3a0bBca877F6f3eAcf`) and then withdraw the tokens calling the `withdrawERC20` from the `L2CustomGateway` contract.

## Alternative Approach: Launch and set up a custom L1 gateway contract

Adding your token to the Scroll official bridge (as described above) is the recommended method of bridging tokens to and from Scroll. This approach will make them easier to discover and safer for holders. However, it will require approval from the Scroll team. If you want to launch a custom token without the official approval process, you can launch a custom gateway yourself. To do so, you will need to deploy an `L1CustomERC20Gateway` contract on L1 and an `L2CustomERC20Gateway` on L2.

### Launch an L1 Custom Gateway

Let’s start by launching the following contract on Sepolia.

```solidity

// This contract will be used to send and receive tokens from L2
contract L1CustomERC20Gateway is L1ERC20Gateway, Ownable {
  // Tokens must be mapped to "bind" them to a token that represents the original token on the original. This event will be emitted when the token mapping for ERC20 token is updated.
  event UpdateTokenMapping(address indexed l1Token, address indexed oldL2Token, address indexed newL2Token);

  mapping(address => address) public tokenMapping;

  constructor() {}

  // This function must be called once after both the L1 and L2 contract was deployed
  function initialize(address _counterpart, address _router, address _messenger) external {
    require(_router != address(0), "zero router address");

    ScrollGatewayBase._initialize(_counterpart, _router, _messenger);
  }

  /// This function returns the address of the token on L2
  function getL2ERC20Address(address _l1Token) public view override returns (address) {
    return tokenMapping[_l1Token];
  }

  // Updates the token mapping that "binds" a token with another one on the other chain
  function updateTokenMapping(address _l1Token, address _l2Token) external onlyOwner {
    require(_l2Token != address(0), "token address cannot be 0");

    address _oldL2Token = tokenMapping[_l1Token];
    tokenMapping[_l1Token] = _l2Token;

    emit UpdateTokenMapping(_l1Token, _oldL2Token, _l2Token);
  }

  // Callback called before a token is withdrawn on L1
  function _beforeFinalizeWithdrawERC20(
    address _l1Token,
    address _l2Token,

    require(_l2Token != address(0), "token address cannot be 0");
    require(_l2Token == tokenMapping[_l1Token], "l2 token mismatch");
  }

  // Token bridged can be "canceled" or dropped. This callback is called before that happens.
  function _beforeDropMessage(address, address, uint256) internal virtual override {
    require(msg.value == 0, "nonzero msg.value");
  }

  // Internal function holding the deposit logic
  function _deposit(
    address _token,
    address _to,
    uint256 _amount,
    bytes memory _data,
    uint256 _gasLimit
  ) internal virtual override nonReentrant {
    address _l2Token = tokenMapping[_token];
    require(_l2Token != address(0), "no corresponding l2 token");

    // 1. Transfer token into this contract.
    address _from;
    (_from, _amount, _data) = _transferERC20In(_token, _amount, _data);

    // 2. Generate message passed to L2CustomERC20Gateway.
    bytes memory _message = abi.encodeCall(
      IL2ERC20Gateway.finalizeDepositERC20,
      (_token, _l2Token, _from, _to, _amount, _data)
    );

    // 3. Send message to L1ScrollMessenger.
    IL1ScrollMessenger(messenger).sendMessage{ value: msg.value }(counterpart, 0, _message, _gasLimit, _from);

    emit DepositERC20(_token, _l2Token, _from, _to, _amount, _data);
  }
}
```

### Launch an L2 Custom Gateway

Now let’s launch the counterpart contract on Scroll.

```solidity

  constructor() {}

  // Like with the L1 version of the Gateway, this must be called once after both the L1 and L2 gateways are deployed
  function initialize(address _counterpart, address _router, address _messenger) external {
    require(_router != address(0), "zero router address");

    ScrollGatewayBase._initialize(_counterpart, _router, _messenger);
  }

  /// Returns the address of the token representing the token on L2
  function getL1ERC20Address(address _l2Token) external view override returns (address) {
    return tokenMapping[_l2Token];
  }

  // This returns the L2 token address
  function getL2ERC20Address(address) public pure override returns (address) {
    revert("unimplemented");
  }

  // This function finalizes the token deposit on L2 when the deposit was not finalized due to not enough gas sent from L1
  function finalizeDepositERC20(
    address _l1Token,
    address _l2Token,
    address _from,
    address _to,
    uint256 _amount,
    bytes calldata _data
  ) external payable override onlyCallByCounterpart nonReentrant {
    require(msg.value == 0, "nonzero msg.value");
    require(_l1Token != address(0), "token address cannot be 0");
    require(_l1Token == tokenMapping[_l2Token], "l1 token mismatch");

    IScrollERC20Extension(_l2Token).mint(_to, _amount);

    _doCallback(_to, _data);

    emit FinalizeDepositERC20(_l1Token, _l2Token, _from, _to, _amount, _data);
  }

  // Same as in the L1 version of this contract, this function "binds" a token with a token on the other chain
  function updateTokenMapping(address _l2Token, address _l1Token) external onlyOwner {
    require(_l1Token != address(0), "token address cannot be 0");

    address _oldL1Token = tokenMapping[_l2Token];
    tokenMapping[_l2Token] = _l1Token;

    emit UpdateTokenMapping(_l2Token, _oldL1Token, _l1Token);
  }

  // Internal function holding the withdraw logic
  function _withdraw(
    address _token,
    address _to,
    uint256 _amount,
    bytes memory _data,
    uint256 _gasLimit
  ) internal virtual override nonReentrant {
    address _l1Token = tokenMapping[_token];
    require(_l1Token != address(0), "no corresponding l1 token");

    require(_amount > 0, "withdraw zero amount");

    // 1. Extract real sender if this call is from L2GatewayRouter.
    address _from = msg.sender;
    if (router == msg.sender) {
      (_from, _data) = abi.decode(_data, (address, bytes));
    }

    // 2. Burn token.
    IScrollERC20Extension(_token).burn(_from, _amount);

    // 3. Generate message passed to L1StandardERC20Gateway.
    bytes memory _message = abi.encodeCall(
      IL1ERC20Gateway.finalizeWithdrawERC20,
      (_l1Token, _token, _from, _to, _amount, _data)
    );

    // 4. send message to L2ScrollMessenger
    IL2ScrollMessenger(messenger).sendMessage{ value: msg.value }(counterpart, 0, _message, _gasLimit);

    emit WithdrawERC20(_l1Token, _token, _from, _to, _amount, _data);
  }
}
```

### Setup your Gateway contract on Sepolia

Once the contracts are deployed, call the following functions to initialize the contracts and bind them to the corresponding tokens and the gateway on the other side of the bridge.

First, call the `initialize` function on the `MyL1Gateway` contract with the following parameters:

- `_counterpart`: The address of `MyL2Gateway` we just launched on Scroll.
- `_router`: Set it to `0x13FBE0D0e5552b8c9c4AE9e2435F38f37355998a`, the `L1GatewayRouter` contract on Sepolia.
- `_messenger`: Set it to `0x50c7d3e7f7c656493D1D76aaa1a836CedfCBB16A`, the `L1ScrollMessenger` contract on Sepolia.

A custom gateway can host multiple token bridges. In this case, we will only be allowing bridging between L1Token and L2Token by calling the `updateTokenMapping` function on the `MyL1Gateway` contract with the following parameters:

- `_l1Token`: The address of the `L1Token` contract we previously launched on Sepolia.
- `_l2Token`: The address of the `L2Token` contract we previously launched on Scroll.

### Setup your Gateway contract on Scroll

Now let’s switch to the Scroll chain and initialize `MyL2Gateway`, following similar steps.

First, call the `initialize` function from `MyL2Gateway`:

- `_counterpart`: The address of `MyL1Gateway` we just launched on Sepolia.
- `_router`: Set it to `0x9aD3c5617eCAa556d6E166787A97081907171230`, the `L2GatewayRouter` contract on Scroll.
- `_messenger`: Set it `0xBa50f5340FB9F3Bd074bD638c9BE13eCB36E603d`, the `L2ScrollMessenger` contract on Scroll.

Next, call `updateTokenMapping` on the `MyL2Gateway` contract:

- `_l2Token`: The address of the `L2Token` contract we previously launched on Scroll.
- `_l1Token`: The address of the `L1Token` contract we previously launched on Sepolia.

### Bridging tokens

We can now call `depositERC20` from `MyL1Gateway` and `withdrawERC20` from `MyL2Gateway` just as with the official Scroll bridge.
