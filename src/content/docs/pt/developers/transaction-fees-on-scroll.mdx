## Overview

Scroll fees are notably lower than on its supporting layer. For users and developers, transaction fees on Scroll appear to work similarly to those on Ethereum mainnet, and existing tools, wallets, and code will likely work as if they were. However, the transaction fee shown in the wallet isn't the whole picture unless the software is specifically aware of Scroll's fee calculations.

Due to the design of L2 rollups, transaction costs depend on the L1's costs. To leverage Ethereum's security, Scroll must account for the cost of the transaction data and proofs that must be stored and verified on the L1.

Compared to Ethereum mainnet, Scroll introduces some new dimensions to transaction fee calculation to do this. The final cost of a transaction is constructed from several parts:

- **L2 fee**
  - Calculated in the same manner as on the L1, equaling `gas_price * gas_used`
- **L1 fee**
  - This additional fee covers sending data to L1 for data availability. Transactions initiated on the L1 do not pay this fee.
  - It is calculated based on the size of the transaction's calldata
  - ETH is automatically deducted from the user’s balance on Scroll for the fee

At a high level, the **L2 fee** is the cost of executing your transaction on the L2 sequencer, and the **L1 fee** is the cost of committing that transaction onto L1.

In short, `totalTxFee = l2Fee + l1Fee`, all denominated in ETH, the native gas token for the Scroll network.

<Aside type="note" title="Where are transaction fees sent?">
All tx fees are collected into the `L2ScrollFeeVault` contract balance. This contract also tracks the amount we’ve historically withdrawn to L1 using `totalProcessed()(uint256)`.

The block producer receives no direct reward, and the `COINBASE` opcode returns the fee vault address.

## L2 Fee

Transactions on Scroll, like on Ethereum, must pay the cost of executing their computations and storing the data they produce.

### Calculating the Execution Fee

The L2 execution fee is straightforward:

```javascript
l2TransactionExecutionFee = l2TransactionGasUsed * l2TransactionGasPrice
```

The total fee depends on what the transaction does (`l2TransactionGasUsed`) as well as the current market conditions (`l2TransactionGasPrice`). Users set the gas price, and the "gas used" is assessed by calling the `estimateGas` endpoint on a Scroll node.

In other words, the execution fee is calculated precisely like pre-[EIP1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559) Ethereum.

## L1 Fee

Every transaction's calldata must be committed to Ethereum, which incurs an additional transaction fee, referred to as the "L1 Fee". Without doing this, Scroll couldn't be reconstructed from only L1 data.

Transactions aren't committed 1-by-1 -- they are collected in batches of blocks (and blocks of transactions). The cost of an individual transaction is computed based on the zeros and non-zero bytes in its payload.

### Estimating the L1 Data Fee

Scroll has a pre-deployed `L1GasPriceOracle` at `0x5300000000000000000000000000000000000002`, accessible on both [Scroll Mainnet](https://scrollscan.com/address/0x5300000000000000000000000000000000000002) and [Scroll Sepolia](https://sepolia.scrollscan.com/address/0x5300000000000000000000000000000000000002). It provides a `getL1Fee` method to estimate the L1 data fee for a given transaction's raw data.

```solidity
function getL1Fee(bytes memory _data) external view override returns (uint256);
```

<Aside type="note" title="What happens if gas prices spike on L1?">

Once the sequencer has processed a transaction, a user's L1 fee is locked in, and any fluctuations will not affect what a user pays.

<br />
Because of Scroll's short block times, any L1 gas changes between a transaction's submission and its inclusion in a block
should be minimal. The sequencer will absorb any changes to L1 gas costs between a transaction's inclusion in a block and
when the sequencer commits the data to L1.

</Aside>

### Calculating the L1 Data Fee with Gas Oracle

As mentioned, the `L1GasPriceOracle` is used to estimate the L1 gas fee given raw transaction data. This is a **push oracle**, updated by a relayer run by Scroll.

The data fee is based on multiple factors:

- The bytes which are `zeros` and `nonzeros` of an RLP-encoded transaction with Signature
- `l1BaseFee` - Current base fee on the L1
- `overhead` - Additional gas overhead of a data commitment transaction
- `scalingFactor` - A scaling factor used to account for price spikes
- `PRECISION` - A constant used to scale the final fee

The following steps are taken to calculate the L1 data fee:

1. Read three fields `l1BaseFee`, `overhead`, `scalar` from the `L1GasPriceOracle` contract. The slots for these fields in the contract are:

   | Field     | Slot |
   | --------- | ---- |
   | l1BaseFee | 1    |
   | overhead  | 2    |
   | scalar    | 3    |

2. Count the number of zero bytes and non-zero bytes from the transaction.
3. Calculate the L1 data fee, given `TX_DATA_ZERO_GAS = 4` and `TX_DATA_NON_ZERO_GAS = 16`[^eip-2028] and `PRECISION = 1e9`:

   ```javascript
   l1Gas = zeros * TX_DATA_ZERO_GAS + (nonzeros + 4) * TX_DATA_NON_ZERO_GAS
   l1GasFee = ((l1Gas + overhead) * l1BaseFee * scalar) / PRECISION
   ```

   We reserve an additional 4 bytes in the non-zero bytes to store the number of bytes in the RLP-encoded transaction.

[^eip-2028]: See [EIP-2028](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2028) for more info.

### L1GasPriceOracle API

#### overhead

```solidity
function overhead() external view returns (uint256);
```

Returns the current L1 fee overhead

#### scalar

```solidity
function scalar() external view returns (uint256);
```

Returns the current l1 fee scalar

#### l1BaseFee

```solidity
function l1BaseFee() external view returns (uint256);
```

Returns the latest known l1 base fee

#### getL1Fee

```solidity
function getL1Fee(bytes memory data) external view returns (uint256);
```

Computes the L1 portion of the fee based on the size of the RLP encoded input transaction, the current L1 base fee, and the various dynamic parameters.

**Returns:** L1 fee that should be paid for the transaction

| Parameter | Description                                                 |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| data      | Signed fully RLP-encoded transaction to get the L1 fee for. |

#### getL1GasUsed

```solidity
function getL1GasUsed(bytes memory data) external view returns (uint256);
```

Computes the amount of L1 gas used for a transaction. Adds the overhead which represents the per-transaction gas overhead of posting the transaction and state roots to L1. Adds 74 bytes of padding to account for the fact that the input does not have a signature.

**Returns:** Amount of L1 gas used to publish the transaction.

| Parameter | Description                                                 |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| data      | Signed fully RLP-encoded transaction to get the L1 fee for. |

## L1 Originated Transactions

When messaging from L1 to L2, the user pays all transaction fees on L1. The user pays L1 gas fees, but because of this, doesn't need to pay Scroll an L1 Data Fee. They will need to account for L2 Execution Fees in their L1 transaction though, and will need to know how much L2 gas to pay.

Contracts on L1 can use an L2 Gas Price Oracle deployed to the L1 to get the gas fee for a given transaction. The oracle also exposes the current l2BaseFee and estimated cross-domain message fee for a given gas limit.

On mainnet, the `L2GasPriceOracle` is deployed at [`0x987e300fDfb06093859358522a79098848C33852`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x987e300fDfb06093859358522a79098848C33852).

On Sepolia, an upgraded `L1MessageQueueWithGasPriceOracle` should be used, deployed to [`0xF0B2293F5D834eAe920c6974D50957A1732de763`](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xF0B2293F5D834eAe920c6974D50957A1732de763).

If your system supports off-chain mechanisms, you can also call `eth_estimateGas` and `eth_gasPrice` on any Scroll RPC node to get an estimate of the gas required for a given transaction.

<Aside type="danger" title="Upgrade Notice">
After the February 2024 Bridge Upgrade, `L2GasPriceOracle` will be deprecated in favor of `L1MessageQueueWithGasPriceOracle`, which will be available at [`0x0d7E906BD9cAFa154b048cFa766Cc1E54E39AF9B`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0d7E906BD9cAFa154b048cFa766Cc1E54E39AF9B).

The upgrade is expected to be finalized on February 21, 2024, after a two-week timelock. Scroll Sepolia has already undergone this upgrade. Read more [here](https://scroll.io/blog/protocol-upgrade-bridging-cost-reduction).

## Future Roadmap

Currently, the computation required for proof generation and gas for proof verification on L1 is subsidized by Scroll and various proving partners. It is partially covered by setting a floor to L2 Gas Price.

As the prover network becomes decentralized, incentives for proof generation will need to be incorporated into the protocol for the system to be sustainable and scalable.

We expect the final gas cost will explicitly include the cost of this proof generation. With further protocol optimization, this cost for the user should be minimal, as each proof covers many transactions.
