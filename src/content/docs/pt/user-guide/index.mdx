Scroll's mainnet is live, but we provide this guide for those wanting to try out Scroll without using real funds.

If you want to try out Scroll mainnet, follow the guide, then use the mainnet links in the sidebar.

Thank you for testing the Scroll Sepolia Testnet. If you have questions or want to give feedback, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/scroll)!

The Sepolia Testnet consists of _Ethereum's Sepolia Testnet_ and the _Scroll Sepolia_ test network. Sepolia is an Ethereum test network, while Scroll Sepolia is a zero knowledge rollup testnet deployed on top of the former. There are some pre-deployed demo applications: a [bridge](https://sepolia.scroll.io/bridge) between _Sepolia_ and _Scroll Sepolia_,[^1] a [block explorer](https://sepolia.scrollscan.com) for _Scroll Sepolia_, and a [rollup explorer](https://sepolia.scroll.io/rollupscan).

To view L1 transactions, check out Etherscan's [Sepolia explorer](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/).
To view L2 transactions, you can use [Scrollscan](https://sepolia.scrollscan.com), or you may also want to try out the additional functionality provided by [Dora](https://www.ondora.xyz/network/scroll-sepolia/interactions) or [L2Scan](https://scroll-sepolia.l2scan.co/).

Here is the suggested workflow to explore the Testnet:

1. Add the [Sepolia Testnet](https://sepolia.scroll.io/portal) configurations to your wallet.
2. Request test tokens in the _Sepolia_ network from any Ethereum Faucet app. (see [Faucet](/user-guide/faucet) article)
3. Transfer test tokens from _Sepolia_ to _Scroll Sepolia_ through the [Bridge](https://sepolia.scroll.io/bridge) app.
4. Transfer tokens to other wallets on _Scroll Sepolia_ using your wallet.
5. Explore our ecosystem, interacting with contracts like [Uniswap](https://uniswap-showcase.sepolia.scroll.xyz/) or [Aave](https://app.aave.com).
6. Withdraw tokens from _Scroll Sepolia_ to _Sepolia_ through the [Bridge](https://sepolia.scroll.io/bridge) app.

You can find the instructions for each app in the rest of this user guide.
