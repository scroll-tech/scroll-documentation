Sentio provides a powerful, all-in-one solution for transaction debugging, simulation, data indexing, and visualization, offering complete context in a single platform.

**_Sentio Debugger:_**

Best tool to help users understand how a transaction works. It has advanced features such as:

- [Simulation](https://docs.sentio.xyz/docs/simulation): Run lightning-fast simulations and inspect the simulation result in great detail
- [Dynamic logging](https://docs.sentio.xyz/docs/dynamic-logging): Add custom `console.log` for transactions to extract specific information, as part of a broader contract override feature
- [Code Insight](https://docs.sentio.xyz/docs/code-insight): Navigate through Solidity code seamlessly, just like in an IDE

**_Sentio Indexer:_**

A state-of-the-art indexing service with integrated user experience:

- Support both [Sentio processor](https://docs.sentio.xyz/docs/processor-basic), a blazing fast data indexer powered by the Sentio SDK that streamlines data ingestion, processing, and storageâ€”all with maximum flexibility in TypeScript, as well as [hosted subgraph processor](https://docs.sentio.xyz/docs/hosted-subgraph)
