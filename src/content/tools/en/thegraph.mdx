Getting historical data on a smart contract can be frustrating when you’re building a dapp. [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) provides an easy way to query smart contract data through APIs known as subgraphs. The Graph’s infrastructure relies on a decentralized network of indexers, enabling your dapp to become truly decentralized.

The Graph supports both Scroll mainnet & testnet.

#### Quick Start

These subgraphs only take a few minutes to set up. To get started, follow these three steps:

1. Initialize your subgraph project
2. Deploy & Publish
3. Query from your dapp

Pricing: **All developers receive 100K free queries per month on the decentralized network**. After these free queries, you only pay based on usage at $4 for every 100K queries.

Here’s a step by step walk through that includes screenshots:
